# Period 4 TLDEW

Hello! We are the TLDEW scrum team. We want to create a website to help adventure seekers find their next trail or trip. Our website will support an interactive map with trails that can be rated by the users. It will have other features that will be implemented in the future. Our website sponsor will be the Del Norte Hiking Club.
